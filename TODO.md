# TODO
-- make it so that email specific boxes aren't always text boxes, but can be dropdown options
-- implement automatic time generation for non SEP and liaison emails
-- make handleInput function be able to handle the class constructor's properties

# FINSIHED
-- Added some Freddy requested text to email for SEP SUB
-- Organize classes and script js to not be inline
-- generate individual squares for each of the 6 different kinds of emails
-- add a button that generates the email once the inputs are put in
-- workout the logic for the generate function so there's not a bunch of redundant code
